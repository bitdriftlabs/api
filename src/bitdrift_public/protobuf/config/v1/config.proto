// A LogMatcher is used to declare a boolean expression which evaluates a log on various facets as either matching or
// not matching. The most basic version of a matcher will just contain a single base matcher which could be used to
// evaluate if a log message matches a given string or is at a particular log level (eg "error"). A more advanced
// matcher could declare AND/OR/NOT expressions which can be nested but ultimately require BaseMatchers at the leaves.
